# Gap Analysis — TanStack AI adapter audit

You are auditing TanStack AI's provider adapters against each provider's
upstream documentation. This is a **maintainer** tool. Your only output is a
markdown report under `.agent/gap-analysis/`. **Do not edit source files.**

## Invocation

| Args                             | Scope                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `<provider>` (e.g. `openai`)     | One provider — all audit dimensions.                  |
| `feature <feature>` (e.g. `tts`) | One feature row of the matrix across all providers.   |
| `models`                         | New-model diff for every provider.                    |
| `activities`                     | Activity-coverage diff: which of the 7 core activity  |
|                                  | kinds each provider ships an adapter for, vs. what    |
|                                  | upstream supports. (Dimension 6 only, all providers.) |
| `--all`                          | Full sweep (fan out subagents, one per provider).     |
| _(none)_                         | Ask the user which scope via AskUserQuestion.         |

## Workflow

1. **Parse scope.** If missing, AskUserQuestion with the four options above.
2. **Load the truth files**, then read the per-scope inputs you need:
   - Matrix: `testing/e2e/src/lib/feature-support.ts`
   - Types: `testing/e2e/src/lib/types.ts` (Provider + Feature unions, ALL_PROVIDERS, ALL_FEATURES)
   - Adapter index: `packages/ai-<provider>/src/index.ts`
   - Model meta: `packages/ai-<provider>/src/model-meta.ts`
   - Core types: `packages/ai/src/types.ts` (Modality, ContentPart, ToolCall)
3. **Research upstream.** Use WebFetch against the curated URLs in
   [references/provider-doc-urls.md](references/provider-doc-urls.md). When a
   doc page has moved, fall back to WebSearch. For SDK API surface details
   use the `context7` MCP server (`mcp__plugin_context7_context7__resolve-library-id`
   then `mcp__plugin_context7_context7__query-docs`).
4. **Walk the audit dimensions** in [references/audit-checklist.md](references/audit-checklist.md):
   1. New models
   2. Cross-adapter feature parity
   3. Untracked features
   4. Capability-flag drift
   5. Telemetry / observability parity (usage tokens, cache/reasoning
      counts, request ids, logging asymmetry)
   6. Activity coverage (which of the 7 core activity kinds each provider
      ships an adapter for vs. what upstream supports) — this is the **only**
      dimension for the `activities` scope; it's also rolled into `--all`.
5. **Fan out** for `--all`: launch one `Explore` subagent per provider, max 3
   in parallel. Each subagent returns the multi-dimension findings for its
   provider; you synthesise into the combined report. The `activities` scope
   does **not** fan out — derive the provider×activity matrix centrally from
   the adapter files (see dimension 6), since it's a fast mechanical diff.
6. **Write the report** to `.agent/gap-analysis/YYYY-MM-DD-<scope>.md` using
   [references/report-template.md](references/report-template.md). Date is
   today's ISO date. `<scope>` is `openai` / `feature-tts` / `models` /
   `activities` / `all`.
7. **Print the report path and a 5-line summary** to the user.

## Critical rules

1. **Never edit `feature-support.ts` or any `model-meta.ts`.** The report is
   read-only — the maintainer applies changes.
2. **Always reference line numbers** when citing exclusions (e.g.,
   `feature-support.ts:57`) so the maintainer can jump to them.
3. **Distinguish three gap classes** in the report:
   - **Real gap** — upstream supports it, TanStack AI doesn't, no exclusion comment.
   - **Tested gap** — TanStack AI doesn't list it but there's an exclusion
     comment in `feature-support.ts` (e.g., aimock format limitation). Not
     actionable code-wise; surface in "Out-of-scope" section.
   - **Stale capability flag** — `model-meta.ts` declares a capability the
     model no longer has, or omits one it now has.
4. **Cite sources.** Every claim "upstream supports X" must link the upstream
   doc page you read. No claims from training data.
5. **Use today's date** from the system context (currentDate). Never invent.
6. **Quote the relevant snippet** from `feature-support.ts` when flagging a
   parity gap, so the report is self-contained.

## Known providers

`openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `ollama`, `grok`, `groq`, `openrouter`, `fal`
(media-only), `elevenlabs` (TTS-only). The feature matrix tracks the first
seven; `fal` and `elevenlabs` only appear in model/media audits.

## Known features (19)

Canonical list is `ALL_FEATURES` in `testing/e2e/src/lib/types.ts` — always
re-read it; this list is a snapshot:

`chat`, `one-shot-text`, `reasoning`, `multi-turn`, `tool-calling`,
`parallel-tool-calls`, `tool-approval`, `text-tool-text`, `structured-output`,
`structured-output-stream`, `agentic-structured`, `multimodal-image`,
`multimodal-structured`, `summarize`, `summarize-stream`, `image-gen`, `tts`,
`transcription`, `video-gen`.

## Known activities (7)

**Features** (above) are matrix rows about behaviours within an activity.
**Activities** are the coarser-grained core capability kinds in `@tanstack/ai`
— each has a `Base<Kind>Adapter` and a provider "supports" one only if its
package ships an adapter of that kind. Canonical list is the `AdapterKind`
union in `packages/ai/src/activities/index.ts` — always re-read it:

`text`, `summarize`, `image`, `audio`, `video`, `tts`, `transcription`.

A provider's activity surface is derived mechanically from its adapter files:
`packages/ai-<provider>/src/adapters/`. Filename → activity-kind map:

| Adapter file                                                 | Activity kind   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `text.ts` / `text-chat-completions.ts` / `responses-text.ts` | `text`          |
| `summarize.ts`                                               | `summarize`     |
| `image.ts`                                                   | `image`         |
| `audio.ts`                                                   | `audio`         |
| `video.ts`                                                   | `video`         |
| `speech.ts` / `tts.ts`                                       | `tts`           |
| `transcription.ts`                                           | `transcription` |

(`cost.ts` is a helper, not an activity adapter.)

## Verification before finishing

Before printing the summary:

- Report file exists and is non-empty.
- `git status` shows only new files under `.agent/gap-analysis/` — nothing
  under `packages/` or `testing/` should have been modified. Run `git status`
  and confirm.
- Every "real gap" entry has an upstream doc URL.
