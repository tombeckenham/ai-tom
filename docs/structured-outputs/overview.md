Structured outputs constrain model responses to match a JSON Schema you control. You get back a typed object — not a string you have to parse, not a "mostly-JSON" blob you have to guess at, not a regex match. The model either returns something that fits your schema or you get a typed error.

You wire this in once with `outputSchema`. The runtime takes care of the rest: it converts your schema to JSON Schema, hands it to the provider's native structured-output API, validates the response, and infers the TypeScript type from your schema definition.

```typescript
import { chat } from "@tanstack/ai";
import { openaiText } from "@tanstack/ai-openai";
import { z } from "zod";

const Person = z.object({ name: z.string(), age: z.number() });

const person = await chat({
  adapter: openaiText("gpt-5.5"),
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "John Doe, 30" }],
  outputSchema: Person,
});

person.name; // string — fully typed, no cast
person.age;  // number
```

## Schema Libraries

TanStack AI accepts any library that implements [Standard JSON Schema](https://standardschema.dev/json-schema):

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) (v4.2+)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) (via `@valibot/to-json-schema`)
- Plain JSON Schema objects (loses TypeScript type inference — see [One-Shot Extraction](./one-shot#using-plain-json-schema))

Refer to your schema library's docs for field descriptions, refinements, and enums. TanStack AI converts the schema to JSON Schema automatically.

## Provider Support

Every adapter handles structured output through its provider's native API:

| Provider | Implementation |
|---|---|
| OpenAI | `response_format` with `json_schema` |
| Anthropic | Tool-based extraction |
| Google Gemini | `responseSchema` |
| Ollama | JSON mode with schema |
| OpenRouter / Grok / Groq | `response_format` with `json_schema` |

The provider-specific details are handled for you — the same `chat({ outputSchema })` call works across all of them.

### Anthropic schema complexity limits

Anthropic compiles a structured-output schema into a grammar and rejects schemas it considers too large or too complex with a 400 error — typically `Schema is too complex for compilation` or `output_config.format.schema: Invalid schema: The compiled grammar is too large`. This affects Claude models directly and `anthropic/*` models routed through OpenRouter, even when every other provider accepts the same schema.

If you hit one of these errors, simplify the schema. Complexity is driven less by overall size than by constructs that multiply the grammar's branching — common offenders:

- `.optional()` fields you don't strictly need
- `.catch()` / `.default()` wrappers (they widen the accepted input)
- Union types and deeply nested objects
- Unconstrained optional strings — tighten with enums or formats where possible

Anthropic's exact limits change over time and aren't all published, so we deliberately don't reproduce the numbers here — see Anthropic's [structured outputs documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) for the current limits and reduction strategies.

## Which page do I read?

Pick the journey that matches what you're building. The four guides under "Structured Outputs" cover non-overlapping use cases — read the one that fits, not all of them.

| You want to… | Read |
|---|---|
| Extract one structured object from a single prompt — and consume it server-side (script, endpoint, CLI) or in a browser via `final` | [One-Shot Extraction](./one-shot) |
| Build a UI that fills in field-by-field as the model streams (progressive form, live card, typewriter preview) | [Streaming UIs](./streaming) |
| Let users iterate on a structured object across multiple turns — each turn produces a new typed object and history stays renderable | [Multi-Turn Chat](./multi-turn) |
| Combine structured output with tool calls (agent loop that runs tools first, then returns a typed object) | [With Tools](./with-tools) |

The streaming and multi-turn paths both build on `useChat({ outputSchema })`. The "with tools" path layers on top of either. Pick the one that describes your shipping shape — start there, follow the cross-links when you need a piece of another story.

> **Note:** Server-side validation is **path-dependent**. For the non-streaming agentic path (`await chat({ outputSchema })`), the engine runs Standard Schema validation inside the finalization step and routes failures through `onError` (the awaited promise rejects). For the streaming path (`chat({ outputSchema, stream: true })`), validation is deliberately deferred to the consumer — the engine forwards the adapter-emitted `structured-output.complete` event verbatim, and consumers read the validated object from the `value.object` field (or call `parseWithStandardSchema` themselves on the raw text). The schema you pass to `useChat({ outputSchema })` on the client is used for TypeScript inference and (in `useChat`) for client-side `parsePartialJSON`-based progressive parsing — the typed-object guarantee comes from the server-side path you pick.

## Middleware integration

Middleware configured on `chat()` now observes the final structured-output
provider call in addition to the agent loop. Chunks from the structured-output
adapter are attributed to `ctx.phase === 'structuredOutput'`; `onFinish` fires
exactly once at the end of the entire run.

> **Path-dependent:** Adapters that natively combine `tools` + a schema-
> constrained final answer in one streaming call do **not** issue a separate
> finalization round-trip. The engine wires `outputSchema` into the regular
> `chatStream` request and harvests the structured result from the agent
> loop's final-turn text. On this path the `'structuredOutput'` middleware
> phase does **not** fire — middleware sees the run through `'beforeModel'`
> / `'modelStream'` as usual, and `onStructuredOutputConfig` is not invoked.
>
> **Native combined providers:**
> - Modern OpenAI (Chat Completions + Responses)
> - Anthropic Claude 4.5+
> - Gemini 3.x
> - Grok 4.x family
>
> **Adapters without native combined-mode support** (Anthropic 4.4-, Gemini
> 2.x, Grok 2/3, Groq, Ollama, OpenRouter) keep the legacy finalization
> path and the `'structuredOutput'` phase fires as before.

### Observing structured-output chunks

```ts
import { chat } from "@tanstack/ai";
import type { ChatMiddleware } from "@tanstack/ai";

const tracing: ChatMiddleware = {
  name: "tracing",
  onChunk(ctx, chunk) {
    // Fires for chunks from the agent loop AND the final structured-output call
    span.addEvent("chunk", { phase: ctx.phase, type: chunk.type });
  },
};
```

### Transforming the JSON Schema before the provider call

Use the `onStructuredOutputConfig` hook when you need to mutate the schema:

```ts
import type { ChatMiddleware } from "@tanstack/ai";

const injectDefs: ChatMiddleware = {
  name: "inject-defs",
  onStructuredOutputConfig(_ctx, config) {
    return {
      outputSchema: { ...config.outputSchema, $defs: { ...sharedDefs } },
    };
  },
};
```

See [Advanced: Middleware](../advanced/middleware.md) for the full hook
reference.
