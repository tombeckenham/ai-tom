  Hosted, provider-managed Agent Skills can now be attached to the server-side execution tool that runs them:
  - **Anthropic** — `codeExecutionTool(config, { skills: [{ type: 'anthropic', skill_id: 'pptx', version: 'latest' }] })`. The adapter lifts the skills into the request's top-level `container.skills` and automatically attaches the required beta headers (`code-execution-2025-08-25` — or `code-execution-2025-05-22` for the legacy `code_execution_20250522` variant — plus `skills-2025-10-02`).
  - **OpenAI** — `shellTool({ environment: { type: 'container_auto', skills: [{ type: 'skill_reference', skill_id: '...', version: '2' }] } })`, threaded through the Responses API shell tool.

  Scope: hosted/managed skills referenced by id + version. Skills are inert without the execution tool that runs them.

  Setting skills via Anthropic's `modelOptions.container.skills` is deprecated in favor of `codeExecutionTool(config, { skills })`.

  Bumps the `openai` SDK to `^6.41.0` (required for the typed shell `environment.skills` surface).

There is no longer a generic root-level sampling surface — each provider accepts its own native keys, fully typed per model:
  - OpenAI (Responses): `modelOptions: { temperature, top_p, max_output_tokens }`
  - Anthropic: `modelOptions: { temperature, top_p, max_tokens }`
  - Gemini: `modelOptions: { temperature, topP, maxOutputTokens }`
  - Grok: `modelOptions: { temperature, top_p, max_tokens }`
  - Groq: `modelOptions: { temperature, top_p, max_completion_tokens }`
  - Ollama: `modelOptions: { options: { temperature, top_p, num_predict } }` (nested)
  - OpenRouter (chat): `modelOptions: { temperature, topP, maxCompletionTokens }`

  Middleware no longer sees `temperature`/`topP`/`maxTokens` as first-class fields on `ChatMiddlewareConfig`; mutate `config.modelOptions` (with the provider-native keys above) instead. `metadata` is unaffected and stays at the root.

  The public `OllamaTextProviderOptions` type export has also been removed from `@tanstack/ai-ollama`. `modelOptions` is now typed per model — use the exported `OllamaChatModelOptionsByName` map (indexed by model name) or the underlying `ChatRequest` from the `ollama` SDK for arbitrary model strings.

  Migrate automatically with the codemod, which resolves the provider from the adapter and rewrites the keys for you:

  ```bash
  pnpm codemod:move-sampling-to-model-options "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
  ```

  See the [Sampling Options migration guide](https://tanstack.com/ai/latest/docs/migration/sampling-options-to-model-options) for details.

### Minor Changes

- [#242](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/242) [`c251038`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/c251038c6d8aa84e498f89e314ce5bb233bc689f) - Enhanced token usage reporting for every provider.

  `TokenUsage` is now the single canonical run-usage type. It is defined once in
  `@tanstack/ai-event-client` (the dependency-free leaf package) and re-exported by
  `@tanstack/ai`, so the two packages can no longer drift. It carries optional
  detailed breakdowns alongside the core token counts: `promptTokensDetails` /
  `completionTokensDetails` (cached, reasoning, audio, and per-modality tokens),
  `durationSeconds` for duration-billed models (e.g. Whisper transcription),
  `providerUsageDetails` for provider-specific metrics, and `cost` / `costDetails`
  for provider-reported cost — so a single `usage` shape covers counts, detailed
  breakdowns, and cost.

  `TokenUsage` is generic over its provider details bag —
  `TokenUsage<TProviderDetails = ProviderUsageDetails>` — so adapters return a
  strongly-typed `providerUsageDetails` (e.g. `TokenUsage<AnthropicProviderUsageDetails>`)
  while generic consumers keep the open-record default. The default,
  `ProviderUsageDetails` (`Record<string, NonNullable<unknown>>`), is now exported and
  uses non-nullish values rather than `unknown` so `TokenUsage` stays assignable across
  JSON-serialization boundaries (e.g. TanStack Start server-fn return types). Each
  provider's usage
  extractor now returns `undefined` (rather than fabricating zeroed totals) when
  the provider reports no usage object, so an absent `usage` is distinguishable
  from a genuine zero-token run.

  `@tanstack/ai` still exports `UsageTotals` as a `@deprecated` alias of
  `TokenUsage` for backward compatibility; it will be removed in a future release.

  Detailed usage is extracted in one place per SDK surface: OpenAI-compatible
  providers (OpenAI, Grok, Groq) share the extractors in `@tanstack/openai-base`,
  while Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, and OpenRouter normalize their own provider
  usage. The devtools surface cached and reasoning token badges per iteration.

  Usage is now unified across **every modality**, not just text/chat. Image, audio,
  and text-to-speech results report the same canonical `TokenUsage` (with
  per-modality breakdowns) instead of a minimal `inputTokens`/`outputTokens` shape:
  - `ImageGenerationResult.usage`, `AudioGenerationResult.usage`, and the new
    `TTSResult.usage` are now typed as `TokenUsage`. **Breaking:** consumers of
    these fields should read `promptTokens`/`completionTokens` instead of
    `inputTokens`/`outputTokens`. `@tanstack/ai-event-client`'s `ImageUsage` is now
    a `@deprecated` alias of `TokenUsage`.
  - OpenAI/Grok image generation surface the text-vs-image input token breakdown
    (`promptTokensDetails`), Gemini image/audio/TTS now surface their full
    `usageMetadata` (previously dropped), and OpenRouter image generation surfaces
    the chat usage it already returns.
  - Bug fixes: Ollama no longer produces `NaN` totals or discards duration-only
    usage; Anthropic defaults missing `output_tokens` and no longer emits empty
    `promptTokensDetails`/`providerUsageDetails` objects; OpenAI GPT-4o
    transcription reads the real audio/text input token breakdown and never falls
    back to duration billing.

  Cross-adapter usage parity fixes:
  - `PromptTokensDetails`/`CompletionTokensDetails` gain a `documentTokens` field,
    and Gemini now surfaces `DOCUMENT` modality token counts (e.g. PDF inputs)
    instead of silently dropping them.
  - OpenAI-compatible chat (OpenAI/Grok/Groq via `@tanstack/openai-base`) now
    surfaces Predicted-Outputs `acceptedPredictionTokens`/`rejectedPredictionTokens`
    under `providerUsageDetails`, matching the OpenRouter adapter (rejected
    prediction tokens are billed).
  - Grok transcription (`/v1/stt`) now reports `durationSeconds`, mirroring the
    Whisper-1 path in the OpenAI transcription adapter.

### Minor Changes

- [#666](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/666) [`c1ae8b9`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/c1ae8b94c83d70508975568eb4fc9b45f1af540b) - feat: support multimodal (image) tool results

  Tools may now return an `Array<ContentPart>` (e.g. a text part plus an image part) and have it transmitted to the model as structured multimodal tool output instead of a `JSON.stringify`'d blob. This unblocks use cases like returning a screenshot from a tool so the model can see it (issue [#363](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/issues/363)).
  - Detection is structural and opt-in by shape: a tool that returns a non-empty array whose every element is a valid `ContentPart` is passed through unchanged; strings and all other return values are serialized exactly as before, so there are no breaking changes.
  - The OpenAI Responses, Anthropic, and Google Gemini adapters convert the content parts into their native multimodal tool-output formats (`function_call_output.output`, `tool_result` content blocks, and `functionResponse.parts` respectively). Providers on the Chat Completions path (Groq, Ollama, Grok, OpenRouter chat) fall back to stringifying, which their APIs require.
  - AG-UI stream events (`TOOL_CALL_RESULT.content`, `TOOL_CALL_END.result`) remain string-only per the spec; the multimodal array travels on the tool message itself.

- [#673](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/673) [`a452ae8`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/a452ae8bcda8abfdc6309983976ed0fbf6df1915) - Populate AG-UI `rawEvent` on `RUN_ERROR` events with the provider's structured error body.

  Previously, when a streaming chat call failed the `RUN_ERROR` event carried only an
  opaque `{ message, code }` headline (e.g. `"Provider returned error"`), and no adapter
  populated AG-UI's purpose-built `rawEvent` field — so the upstream provider detail was
  unrecoverable.

  Adapters now forward the provider's **structured error body** (e.g. an SDK `APIError`'s
  parsed `.error` response body, or OpenRouter's mid-stream `chunk.error`) as `rawEvent`
  on the `RUN_ERROR` event. The new `toRunErrorRawEvent` helper extracts only known
  provider-body fields — never the raw SDK exception object, which can carry request
  metadata such as auth headers. The `{ message, code }` contract of `toRunErrorPayload`
  is unchanged.

  The error surfaced to consumers via the `ChatClient` / `useChat` `error` (and the
  `onError` callback) now also carries `code` and `rawEvent` when present, so the upstream
  cause is recoverable in application code.

  > Note: the OpenRouter SDK parses each in-band stream chunk's `error` through a strict
  > schema (`{ code, message }`), so provider `metadata` survives only on pre-stream HTTP
  > errors (rate-limit / overload / BYOK rejection), whose typed error class exposes the
  > full body via `.error`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Route `chat({ outputSchema, tools })` through the provider's native single-pass call where supported (modern OpenAI Chat Completions + Responses, Claude 4.5+, Gemini 3.x, Grok 4.x family). Closes #605. ([#609](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/609))

  Historically, `chat({ outputSchema, tools })` ran the agent loop with `tools` and then issued a separate finalization call against the structured-output adapter for the typed answer — because most providers couldn't combine `tools` with a schema-constrained response in one call. That has changed for most modern providers, making the second round-trip pure overhead.

  **New per-adapter capability:** `TextAdapter.supportsCombinedToolsAndSchema?(modelOptions?)`. Adapters that opt in receive a JSON Schema on `TextOptions.outputSchema` in `chatStream` and wire it into the upstream request alongside `tools`. The engine harvests the final-turn JSON from the agent loop's accumulated text — no separate finalization call, no `'structuredOutput'` middleware phase.

  **Per-adapter status:**
  - **OpenAI (Chat Completions + Responses):** opted in for all models. `response_format: json_schema` / `text.format: json_schema` attached when `outputSchema` is set.
  - **Anthropic:** opted in for Claude 4.5+ (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku 4.5, 4.6, 4.7). Wires `output_config.format` on the beta Messages request. Pre-4.5 Claude models keep the forced-tool finalization workaround. Gated by exported `ANTHROPIC_COMBINED_TOOLS_AND_SCHEMA_MODELS`.
  - **Gemini:** opted in for Gemini 3.x (3-pro, 3-flash, 3.1-pro-preview, 3.1-flash-lite). Wires `responseSchema` + `responseMimeType: 'application/json'` into the regular `generateContentStream` call. Gemini 2.x keeps the legacy path. Gated by exported `GEMINI_COMBINED_TOOLS_AND_SCHEMA_MODELS`.
  - **Grok (xAI):** opted in for the Grok 4 family (`grok-4`, `grok-4-1-fast-*`, `grok-4-fast-*`, `grok-4-20*`, `grok-4-3`, `grok-code-fast-1`). Inherits the OpenAI Chat Completions wiring from `openai-base`; the override gates the capability claim by model. Grok 2 / 3 keep the legacy path. Gated by exported `GROK_COMBINED_TOOLS_AND_SCHEMA_MODELS`.
  - **Groq:** explicitly opts out — the Groq API rejects `response_format` + `tools` + `stream` with HTTP 400 ("Streaming and tool use are not currently supported with Structured Outputs").
  - **OpenRouter, Ollama:** unchanged; still take the legacy finalization path. OpenRouter's per-request capability lookup (depends on resolved upstream model) is tracked as a follow-up.

  **Backward compatibility:**
  - `'structuredOutput'` middleware phase still fires for fallback-path adapters. It does NOT fire for adapters that handle the combination natively — middleware sees the run through `'beforeModel'` / `'modelStream'` as usual.
  - `onStructuredOutputConfig` keeps its existing surface but only fires on the fallback path.
  - No call-site changes required.

  `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, and `useDefineForClassFields` in the

  `packages/*/src/**` that turns on `no-floating-promises`,
  `no-misused-promises`, `await-thenable`,
  `switch-exhaustiveness-check`, `consistent-type-exports`,
  `prefer-readonly`, and `no-non-null-assertion` (errors), plus
  `no-explicit-any` (warning). `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-nocheck` are
  disallowed in library source via `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment`,
  and `as unknown as <T>` double-casts are blocked by a
  `no-restricted-syntax` rule (escape hatches available with an inline
  reason). Two flags from the original five-flag set —
  `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
  — were tried and rolled back: they produced ~500 lines of bracket-
  access and conditional-spread churn without catching any real bugs,
  and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` would have forced consumers using
  it themselves to deal with our internals' style preferences.

  User-visible API surface is unchanged; this is a hardening pass to
  keep streaming/agent-loop correctness and discriminated-union
  exhaustiveness honest going forward. See issue #564.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- feat(ai): `systemPrompts` accept `{ content, metadata }` with adapter-inferred metadata typing ([#575](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/575))

  `chat({ systemPrompts })` now accepts either a plain string (the existing
  shape — fully backward compatible) or `{ content, metadata }`. The `metadata`
  field's type is inferred from the adapter via a new
  `TSystemPromptMetadata` generic on `TextAdapter` / `BaseTextAdapter`:
  - `@tanstack/ai-anthropic` declares `AnthropicSystemPromptMetadata` →
    users get `cache_control` autocomplete and type-checking on
    `systemPrompts[i].metadata` for Anthropic chats.
  - Adapters with no per-prompt metadata (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama,
    OpenRouter, openai-base) inherit the default `never`, which means the
    `metadata` field carries no meaningful value at the call site —
    TypeScript only accepts `undefined` there. Provider-foreign metadata
    that reaches an adapter via JS / `as any` is silently dropped, never
    written to the wire.

  ```ts
  import { chat } from '@tanstack/ai'
  import { anthropicText } from '@tanstack/ai-anthropic'

  // Anthropic — `cache_control` is autocompleted, no `satisfies` needed.
  chat({
    adapter: anthropicText({ apiKey }, 'claude-sonnet-4-6'),
    systemPrompts: [
      {
        content: 'Stable instructions — cache me.',
        metadata: { cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' } },
      },
      'Volatile per-request instruction.',
    ],
  })

  // OpenAI — `metadata` is `never`; only `undefined` is assignable, so the
  // field is effectively unusable. The object form without `metadata` still
  // works for portability.
  chat({
    adapter: openaiText({ apiKey }, 'gpt-4o-mini'),
    systemPrompts: [
      'Plain string.',
      { content: 'Object form without metadata is allowed.' },
    ],
  })
  ```

  New exports:
  - `@tanstack/ai`: `SystemPrompt`, `NormalizedSystemPrompt` types and the
    `normalizeSystemPrompts()` helper adapters use to normalize the wide
    input shape to `{ content, metadata? }` before consumption.
  - `@tanstack/ai-anthropic`: `AnthropicSystemPromptMetadata` interface
    (currently exposes `cache_control` for prompt caching).

  Internal:
  - New `TSystemPromptMetadata = never` generic on `TextAdapter` /
    `BaseTextAdapter`, surfaced via `'~types'['systemPromptMetadata']`
    for inference at the `chat()` call site.
  - Anthropic adapter reads `metadata.cache_control` and attaches it to
    the corresponding `TextBlockParam`.
  - All other text adapters call `normalizeSystemPrompts()` and join
    `.content` for their respective `instructions` / `system` /
    `systemInstruction` fields. Foreign metadata that reaches them via JS
    / `as any` is dropped (never written to the wire).
  - `normalizeSystemPrompts()` is the public API boundary and throws
    `TypeError` (naming the offending index) for object-form entries whose
    `content` isn't a string — preventing literal `"undefined"` from
    reaching the model on stale call sites.
  - OpenTelemetry middleware attaches per-prompt metadata as the
    `tanstack.ai.system_prompt.metadata` JSON span attribute when
    `captureContent: true` and at least one entry carries metadata, so
    observability backends can distinguish cache hit/miss for Anthropic.
  - `@tanstack/ai-event-client` mirrors the `SystemPrompt` shape locally
    (avoids a circular import) and projects metadata away on the devtools
    wire — devtools UI still receives `Array<string>`.

  ## Core — `@tanstack/ai`
  - New `chat({ outputSchema, stream: true })` overload returning `StructuredOutputStream<InferSchemaType<TSchema>>`. The stream yields raw JSON deltas via `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` plus a terminal `CUSTOM` `structured-output.complete` event whose `value.object` is typed against the caller's schema with no helper or cast required.
  - `StructuredOutputStream<T>` is a discriminated union over three tagged `CUSTOM` variants — `structured-output.complete<T>`, `approval-requested`, and `tool-input-available` (new `ApprovalRequestedEvent` / `ToolInputAvailableEvent` interfaces exported from `@tanstack/ai`). Narrowing on `chunk.type === 'CUSTOM' && chunk.name === '<literal>'` resolves `chunk.value` to the exact shape per variant. The bare `CustomEvent` (with `value: any`) is deliberately excluded to keep the narrow from collapsing to `any`; user-emitted events via the `emitCustomEvent` context API still flow at runtime and are documented as a small residual gap.
  - Activity-layer hardening: always-finalise after the stream loop (no silent hangs on missing `finishReason`), typed `RUN_ERROR` on empty content, mid-stream provider errors terminate cleanly, schema-validation failures carry `runId / model / timestamp`.
  - `fallbackStructuredOutputStream` in the activity layer is the single source of truth for adapters that don't implement `structuredOutputStream` natively; `BaseTextAdapter` no longer ships a default.
  - `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter.summarizeStream` accumulates summary text and emits a terminal `CUSTOM` `generation:result` event before the final `RUN_FINISHED`. Fixes `useSummarize` never populating `result` over streaming connections (the client only sets `result` on that specific CUSTOM event).
  - `SummarizationOptions` is now generic in `TProviderOptions` and `modelOptions` is plumbed through end-to-end (previously silently dropped by `runSummarize` / `runStreamingSummarize`).

  ## Framework hooks — `@tanstack/ai-react`, `@tanstack/ai-vue`, `@tanstack/ai-solid`, `@tanstack/ai-svelte`

  `useChat` (React/Vue/Solid) and `createChat` (Svelte) now accept an `outputSchema` option mirroring `chat({ outputSchema })` on the server. When supplied, the hook's return adds two managed reactive fields:
  - `partial` — the live progressive object, typed `DeepPartial<InferSchemaType<typeof outputSchema>>`. Updated from `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` deltas via `parsePartialJSON`. Resets on every new run.
  - `final` — the validated terminal payload from the `structured-output.complete` event, typed `InferSchemaType<typeof outputSchema> | null`. `null` until the run completes.

  Both fields are typed against the schema with no helper or cast — each hook is generic on `TSchema` and conditionally adds the fields to the return type. Without `outputSchema`, the return type is unchanged. Works the same for streaming and non-streaming endpoints — for non-streaming, `partial` stays `{}` and `final` snaps when the single terminal event arrives. Reasoning text and tool calls aren't surfaced as separate hook fields — they're already on `messages[…].parts` (as `ThinkingPart`, `ToolCallPart`, `ToolResultPart`), same as a normal chat. When `outputSchema` is set, the assistant's `TextPart` contains the raw JSON the model produced; filter `text` parts out of your message renderer and let the structured view (driven by `partial` / `final`) replace it.

  Reactivity primitive per framework:

  | Framework                      | `partial` type                                          | `final` type                                     |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | React (`@tanstack/ai-react`)   | `DeepPartial<T>` (plain state)                          | `T \| null` (plain state)                        |
  | Vue (`@tanstack/ai-vue`)       | `Readonly<ShallowRef<DeepPartial<T>>>`                  | `Readonly<ShallowRef<T \| null>>`                |
  | Solid (`@tanstack/ai-solid`)   | `Accessor<DeepPartial<T>>`                              | `Accessor<T \| null>`                            |
  | Svelte (`@tanstack/ai-svelte`) | `readonly partial: DeepPartial<T>` (rune-backed getter) | `readonly final: T \| null` (rune-backed getter) |

  `DeepPartial<T>` is exported from each framework package for callers who want to annotate handlers explicitly.

  ## Base — `@tanstack/openai-base`
  - Package renamed from `@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible` (which remains published for pinned lockfiles but receives no further updates). Imports change:

    ```diff
    - import { OpenAICompatibleChatCompletionsTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible'
    + import { OpenAIBaseChatCompletionsTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/openai-base'
    - import { OpenAICompatibleResponsesTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible'
    + import { OpenAIBaseResponsesTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/openai-base'
    ```

  - Centralised `structuredOutputStream` on both bases. Chat Completions uses `response_format: { type: 'json_schema', strict: true }` + `stream: true`; Responses uses `text.format: { type: 'json_schema', strict: true }` + `stream: true`. Subclasses (`ai-openai`, `ai-grok`, `ai-groq`) inherit it; OpenRouter implements its own (see below).
  - Base now adopts the `openai` SDK directly and imports types from `openai/resources/...`. The previously-vendored ~720 LOC of wire-format types (`ChatCompletion`, `ResponseStreamEvent`, etc.) is removed; consumers that imported wire types from the package should import them from the openai SDK instead. The abstract `callChatCompletion*` / `callResponse*` hooks are gone — the base constructor now takes a pre-built `OpenAI` client (`new OpenAIBaseChatCompletionsTextAdapter(model, name, openaiClient)`) and calls `client.chat.completions.create` / `client.responses.create` itself.
  - New protected `isAbortError(error)` hook duck-types abort detection so `RUN_ERROR { code: 'aborted' }` is emitted consistently across SDK error types — subclasses with proprietary error classes (e.g. `@openrouter/sdk`'s `RequestAbortedError`) override.
  - Per-chunk `logger.provider(...)` debug logging now fires inside `structuredOutputStream` loops, matching the existing pattern in `chatStream` for end-to-end introspection in debug mode.

  The other extension hooks (`extractReasoning`, `extractTextFromResponse`, `processStreamChunks`, `makeStructuredOutputCompatible`, `transformStructuredOutput`, `mapOptionsToRequest`, `convertMessage`) remain. Groq's `processStreamChunks` and `makeStructuredOutputCompatible` overrides (for `x_groq.usage` promotion and Groq's structured-output schema quirks) are unchanged.

  ## Provider adapters

  | Adapter                                                    | API              | Reasoning surface                                                                                                |
  | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openai` `openaiText`                         | Responses        | `response.reasoning_text.delta` + `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` (requires `reasoning.summary: 'auto'`) |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openai` `openaiChatCompletions` (new)        | Chat Completions | reasoning emitted silently — Chat Completions has no `reasoning.summary` opt-in                                  |
  | `@tanstack/ai-grok` `grokText`                             | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoning_content` (DeepSeek convention; not typed by OpenAI SDK)                                         |
  | `@tanstack/ai-groq` `groqText`                             | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoning` (requires `reasoning_format: 'parsed'`; not typed by groq-sdk)                                 |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` `openRouterText`                 | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoningDetails` (camelCase)                                                                             |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` `openRouterResponsesText` (beta) | Responses (beta) | `response.reasoning_text.delta` + `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` via `normalizeStreamEvent`             |

  All six emit the contractual `REASONING_*` lifecycle (`REASONING_START` → `REASONING_MESSAGE_START` → `REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT` deltas → `REASONING_MESSAGE_END` → `REASONING_END`) and close it before `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`. Accumulated reasoning is also surfaced on `structured-output.complete.value.reasoning` for consumers that only subscribe to the terminal event. OpenRouter SDK's proprietary `RequestAbortedError` is mapped (alongside DOM `AbortError`) to `code: 'aborted'` in the two openrouter adapters.

  `@tanstack/ai-openai` also exports a new `OpenAIChatCompletionsTextAdapter` / `openaiChatCompletions` / `createOpenaiChatCompletions` factory — a sibling to the existing Responses adapter for callers who want the older `/v1/chat/completions` wire format against the OpenAI SDK.

  ## Decouple `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` from the OpenAI base

  OpenRouter ships its own SDK (`@openrouter/sdk`) with a camelCase shape, so inheriting from the OpenAI-shaped base forced a snake_case ↔ camelCase round-trip on every request and stream event. ai-openrouter now extends `BaseTextAdapter` directly and inlines its own stream processors (`OpenRouterTextAdapter` for chat-completions, `OpenRouterResponsesTextAdapter` for the Responses beta), reading OpenRouter's camelCase types natively. The `@tanstack/openai-base` and `openai` dependencies are removed from ai-openrouter; only `@openrouter/sdk`, `@tanstack/ai`, and `@tanstack/ai-utils` remain. The ~300 LOC of inbound/outbound shape converters (`toOpenRouterRequest`, `toChatCompletion`, `adaptOpenRouterStreamChunks`, `toSnakeResponseResult`, …) are gone. Internal: duck-typed `as { ... }` casts on stream chunks in `OpenRouterResponsesTextAdapter` are replaced with direct narrowing via the SDK's discriminated unions.

  Public OpenRouter API is unchanged: `openRouterText`, `openRouterResponsesText`, `createOpenRouterText`, `createOpenRouterResponsesText`, the OpenRouter tool factories, provider routing surface (`provider`, `models`, `plugins`, `variant`, `transforms`), app attribution headers (`httpReferer`, `appTitle`), `:variant` model suffixing, `RequestAbortedError` propagation, and the OpenRouter-specific structured-output null-preservation all behave the same.

  `ai-ollama` remains on `BaseTextAdapter` directly — its native API uses a different wire format from Chat Completions and was never on the shared base.

  ## Summarize subsystem

  Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, and OpenRouter previously each shipped a bespoke 200–300 LOC summarize adapter. They now construct a `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter` (formerly `ChatStreamWrapperAdapter`, renamed and exported from `@tanstack/ai/activities`) wrapping their own text adapter, matching the existing OpenAI/Grok pattern. Removes ~600 LOC of duplicated logic across the six providers and ensures behavioural parity.

  Bespoke `*SummarizeProviderOptions` interfaces (e.g. `OpenAISummarizeProviderOptions`, `AnthropicSummarizeProviderOptions`, `GeminiSummarizeProviderOptions`, `OllamaSummarizeProviderOptions`, `OpenRouterSummarizeProviderOptions`) are removed from the provider packages' public exports. Consumers who imported them should switch to inferring the type from the adapter (`InferTextProviderOptions<typeof adapter>`) or remove the explicit annotation (it'll be inferred from the adapter argument).

  `SummarizeAdapter` interface methods are now generic in `TProviderOptions`. `summarize` and `summarizeStream` previously took `SummarizationOptions` (defaulted, so `modelOptions` was effectively `Record<string, any>` regardless of the adapter's typed shape). They now take `SummarizationOptions<TProviderOptions>`. Source-compatible for callers that didn't specify the generic; type-tighter for implementers and downstream consumers. `SummarizationOptions`, `SummarizeAdapter`, `BaseSummarizeAdapter`, and `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter` previously had a mixed `Record<string, any>` / `Record<string, unknown>` / `object` set of defaults for `TProviderOptions`; they now uniformly default to `Record<string, unknown>`.
