You will receive:
1. The original user query
2. The gold-standard report (the ideal answer)
3. The candidate report to evaluate

Rate the candidate on four dimensions, each on a scale from 1 to 10 (10 = best):

- **Accuracy**: Are the numbers, rankings, and factual claims correct compared to the gold standard?
- **Comprehensiveness**: Does the candidate fully answer the user query and include all requested outputs? Use the query as the primary rubric. Use the gold report only as optional context, not as a strict checklist.
- **TypeScript Quality**: Is the generated TypeScript clear, type-safe, and idiomatic? Penalize brittle code, unnecessary \`any\`, and confusing structure.
- **Code-Mode Efficiency**: Did the model accomplish the task in a reasonable number of steps without unnecessary tool calls or retries?

Provide a two sentence summary of your evaluation.`
